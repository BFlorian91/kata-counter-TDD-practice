# TDD Training with Jest, React, and TypeScript

This project is an exercise in Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Jest, React, and TypeScript. The main goal of this project was to improve my development skills by following a rigorous TDD approach.

## Project Goals

- Apply the Test-Driven Development (TDD) concept by developing a small application.
- Use Jest as the test framework to write unit tests.
- Implement React components following a TDD approach, starting with tests.
- Incorporate TypeScript to enhance code safety and maintainability.
- Test various scenarios, including component unit tests and state management.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Jest: A popular JavaScript testing framework.
- TypeScript: A programming language that adds static types to JavaScript.
- HTML/CSS: For the structure and styling of the application.

## Application Features

- The application is a simple counter that allows adding and subtracting values.
- Unit tests were written for each feature, following the TDD approach.
- TypeScript was used to define strong types and ensure code safety.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm start` to launch the application in development mode.
5. Run `pnpm test` to execute unit tests with Jest.

Feel free to explore the source code and run the tests to better understand the TDD development process used in this project.
